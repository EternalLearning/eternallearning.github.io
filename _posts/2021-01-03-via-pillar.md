title: Via Pillar
---

Via pillar is a new technology that aims to reduce via resistance and increase electromigration robustness for enhanced performance.

Via pillars are composed of stacked parallel wire segments on intermediate layers. Each of the wire segments, except in the top layer, is connected above and below. The entire via pillar structure looks like the Jenga tower in the popular game. The individual wire segments are sometimes called fingers. There must be exactly one finger in the top layer of the via pillars.

**Benefits of adding via pillars in design**
- Preventing EM violations.
- Improving timing performance.(by reducing output net RC delay)
- Improving utilization.
- Replacing multicut via at DPT layers.
