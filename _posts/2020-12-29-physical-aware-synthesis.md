The following files are needed for flow execution:

- Tech lef and standard cell (.lef) files
LEF files are ASCII files that contain physical library information such as layer, via, placement site type, routing design rules, process information, and standard cell and macro cell definitions.

In this flow, the cell area defined in the LEF libraries is used instead of the cell area defined in the timing library (.lib).

For best results, always use all available LEF files (standard cell, macro and technology LEF).

- Liberty (.lib) files — standard cell files
- Floorplan (.def) file
- QRC techfile— required for good R/C correlation
QRC technology files contains the same type of parasitic information as the LEF files but the resistance and capacitance information in these files have a finer granularity.

The capacitance in a LEF comes from a foundry and is generated by whatever process it sees as appropriate. The capacitance information in QRC technology file comes from the same process definition files that drive sign off extraction as well as the various other extractors used in Cadence tools. The process definition files define layer thicknesses, compositions, and spacing.

- MMMC configuration file
