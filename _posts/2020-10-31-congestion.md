title: Congestion
---

If the number of routing tracks available in one particular area is less than the required number of routing tracks then it is called congestion.

**Reasons for congestion:**
- High standard cell density in an area.
- placement of standard cells near macros.
- high pin density at the edge of macro.
- bad floorplan.

**How to fix congestion?**
- Rerun the placement with congestion effort high.
- Modify physical constraints such as adjust cell density in congested areas.
- Use or modify proper blockages.
- Modify floorplanning to give enough room for routing.
