title: Clock Domain Crossing

## What is Metastability?
Any discussion of clock domain crossing (CDC) should start with a basic understanding of metastability and synchronization. In layman’s terms, metastability refers to an unstable intermediate state, where the slightest disturbance will cause a resolution to a stable state. When applied to flip-flops in digital circuits, it means a state where the flip-flop’s output may not have settled to the final expected value.

One of the ways a flip-flop can enter a metastable state is if its setup or hold time is violated. In an asynchronous clock domain crossing (CDC), where the source and destination clocks have no frequency relationship, a signal from the source domain has a non-zero probability of changing within the setup or hold time of a destination flip-flop it drives. Synchronization failure occurs when the output of the destination flip-flop goes metastable and does not converge to a legal state by the time its output must be sampled again (by the next flip-flop in the destination domain). Worse yet, that next flip-flop may also go metastable, causing metastability to propagate through the design!

## Synchronizers for Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)
A synchronizer is a circuit whose purpose is to minimize the probability of a synchronization failure. We want the metastability to resolve within a synchronization period (a period of the destination clock) so that we can safely sample the output of the flip-flop in the destination clock domain. It is possible to calculate the failure rate of a synchronizer, and this is called the mean time between failure (MTBF).

Without going into the math, the takeaway is that the probability of hitting a metastable state in a clock domain crossing (CDC) is proportional to:

- Frequency of the destination domain.
- Rate of data crossing the clock boundary.

## Two flip-flop synchronizer

The most basic synchronizer is two flip-flop in series, both clocked by the destination clock. This simple and unassuming circuit is called a two flip-flop synchronizer. If the input data changes very close to the receiving clock edge (within setup/hold time), the first flip-flop in the synchronizer may go metastable, but there is still a full clock for the signal to become stable before being sampled by the second flip-flop. The destination domain logic then uses the output from the second flip-flop. Theoretically it is possible for the signal to still be metastable by the time it is clocked into the second flip-flop (every MTBF years). In that case a synchronization failure occurs and the design would likely malfunction.

The two flip-flop synchronizer is sufficient for many applications. Very high speed designs may require a three flip-flop synchronizer to give sufficient MTBF. To further increase MTBF, two flip-flop synchronizers are sometimes built from fast library cells (low threshold voltage) that have better setup/hold time characteristics.

## Synchronizing Slow Signals Into Fast Clock Domain
The easy case is passing signals from a slow clock domain to a fast clock domain. This is generally not a problem as long as the faster clock is > 1.5x frequency of the slow clock. The fast destination clock will simply sample the slow signal more than once. In these cases, a simple two-flip-flop synchronizer may suffice.

If the fast clock is < 1.5x frequency of the slow clock, then there can be a potential problem, and you should use one of the solutions in the next section.

## Synchronizing Fast Signals Into Slow Clock Domain
The more difficult case is, of course, passing a fast signal into a slow clock domain. The obvious problem is if a pulse on the fast signal is shorter than the period of the slow clock, then the pulse can disappear before being sampled by the slow clock. This scenario is shown in the waveform below.

A less obvious problem is even if the pulse was just slightly wider than the period of the slow clock, the signal can change within the setup/hold time of the destination flip-flop (on the slow clock), violating timing and causing metastability.
